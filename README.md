Software Development Labs
My project is on a program which will display a series of different programs. The main program will be an Index page that will allow you to select which ever program you want. In this project I will be using GitHub and TextPad. To clone the code from Github to your computer you enter this, cd /c/users/g00363047/downloads/
git init
rm -rf first-repository
git clone https://github.com/deji150/first-repository
cd first-repository.
For you to clone it from the computer to Github you enter, 
git add .
git commit -m "some message regarding lab"
git push
